  title: Writing DNS over HTTPS Server in Ruby
  abstract: "What happens after someone typed URL into a web browser, or when an application sends a request to the API endpoint for the first time? As a software engineer or web developer, it would be nice if we knew how domain name lookup and HTTP work, an important part on which the World Wide Web was built. Meanwhile, with privacy concerns arise, DNS over HTTPS (DoH) has gained popularity lately. Its use can prevent the recording and modification of information about the destination host by a third party. Many browsers and HTTP clients, such as Firefox and cURL, can already use DoH. In this talk, we will learn how the process of domain name lookup and  HTTP server works by writing a DoH server in Ruby."

  short_bio: "I was a machine learning engineer that start a new journey as back-end Engineer at Bukalapak last year. Currently, I focus on developing loyalty point feature for Mitra Bukalapak using Ruby on Rails with the help of my amazing team mate. I believe that the ultimate form of learning is when you celebrate your mistake by sharing to other and ensure that no one makes the same mistake. That's why I'm looking forward to share my experience as back-end engineer at Bukalapak with ruby community."
  title: How Database Index Optimize Your Query for Dummies
  abstract: "Leaky abstraction is a case when something goes wrong with abstraction that we use, but we don’t know why. Most likely it happens simply because we forget or too lazy to understand the system behind the abstraction. This case is also happen in query optimization especially when it involves index. Using Ruby ORM such as ActiveRecord or Sequel is convenient. It does a good job to abstract how query planner, and storage engine actually works, but sometimes it creates misconception that results into slow queries or inefficient use of index. On the other hand trying to understand how index actually implemented in various storage engine is quite challenging. Therefore by using simple mental map that visualizes index as some variation of sorted hash-map, we will discuss BTree database indexing in InnoDB Engine. Once we understand the fundamental concept of database index, then we will discuss various query example and try to analyze which query is inefficient and why."

  title: Motor-on-voice, an experiment using mruby/c and Sinatra
  abstract: "The usage of smart assistants is rapidly increasing day by day.
    Smart assistants can keep things simple and easily accessible.
    Most importantly it can reduce effort and time consumption.

    Nowadays it is not necessary to own a smart device like Alexa Echo, Google Home or any other. A cheaper option to install it on our phone is available for free now; it has improved the portability factor as well.

    This is an experiment to trigger motor and check the motor's running status by using voice commands.

    API’s required for Alexa Skill is developed using Sinatra, a Ruby web application framework and Motor operations are implemented by using mruby/c"

  title: State of the art of managing assets in the new Rails world
  abstract: "Rails 6 will use webpacker to manage JavaScript code instead of asset pipeline aka sprockets. We have lot of questions to answer. Why webpacker? What does it bring to the table? What about my old code? Is Webpacker same as the old asset pipeline? In this talk we will unravel this mystery and see ways to manage our same old JavaScript in a whole new way."

  title: "Ruby: The Reality Stone"
  abstract: "This hidden gems will save your life; One of six Infinity Stone that could shape your reality, because everything will be your object you can manipulate. Legend has it the stone called Ruby. Ruby's flexibility and expressiveness makes it great for performing signature moves (DSLs) and forging armors (frameworks) and for making spells (writing code) with very little boilerplate (no gauntlet needed). And after more than a decade, Ruby is still the easiest language you can learn. So prepare your minecart, put it on Rails, and get your own Ruby: The Reality Stone."
