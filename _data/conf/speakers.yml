    Since 2014, I help run the Lambda Jakarta functional programming meetup dedicated to improving developer productivity in Indonesia. I'm passionate about helping people increase their productivity by conquering the most difficult concepts in their field in creative and imaginative ways so that what they've learned stay with them for the rest of their lives. The last talk I gave at Lambda was on "How Giving Talks Is Vital To Your Software Dev Career (BONUS: One Tip To Make It Super Effective)".

Won't it do the opposite by making programming harder? This talk will blow your mind by filling you in on the missing story that makes immutability productive.

  title: "Blockchains on Ruby"
  abstract: Blockchain is an interesting concept and sounds futuristic, and yet mysterious to most. It is the basic building of the Etherium and Bitcoin cryptocurrency, which source code, a complex one, could be available for reading.

    I studied finance in the university but then fell in love with ruby when trying out a bunch of languages on Codecademy. Then my mind gets more blown (is that the correct grammar?) when watching the how to quickly develop blog using Rails. Start following a number of tutorials (the one by Michael Hartl is the best starting point for learning Rails, IMHO), then build a couple of apps on my own. 3 years later now I am a software developer @ HarukaEdu, and the best thing is I have the ability to make my ideas into reality.
  title: "Using Rails 5 As Your API Backend May Not Be The Stupidest Idea"
  abstract: Ruby on Rails is dead, they say. With asynchronous Web App becoming the new norm, NodeJS and Golang has become the go-to tools for writing backend. Is there really a place for this 10-year-old, battle-tested web framework, in the API-builders battlefield? I say there (maybe) is.

  title: "But server processed wrong submission! Understanding Race Condition"
  abstract: "You built an application. Then you scaled up your application, added more user, added more servers. Everything would seem fine until at some moment, server may get different outcomes processing data with the same data in high traffic application. It might be race condition: altering/submitting data in unsafe manner. It can be SQL, thread, or even multi-machine communication. Race condition is catastrophic because it does not show up in small, low-traffic application. In this talk, i will tell what race condition is and we will see common pitfall in building high traffic application. Of course we will also discuss on how to avoid it in Rails."
