              <p>Now, Ruby has several concurrency management features: Threads and Fibers.
Threads support preemptive context switching and Fibers are for self
context management. Further more, I proposing new concurrency feature
"Guild" for Ruby 3. Guild support "isolation" for parallel execution.
They have advantages and disadvantages. In this talk, I will introduce current features and discuss pros. and
cons. Also I will show you the new feature "Guild" and why it is needed.
With this talk, you can understand Ruby's concurrency deeply.</p>

              <p>Ruby on Rails is dead, they say. With asynchronous Web App becoming the new norm, NodeJS and Golang has become the go-to tools for writing backend. Is there really a place for this 10-year-old, battle-tested web framework, in the API-builders battlefield? I say there (maybe) is.</p>

              <p>API versioning is a simple yet sensitive issue. Doing it wrong, you'll certainly see a cold war between API and mobile app devs, not to mention angry clients with their unusable app because of API-incompatibility issue. This talk will show how to handle API versioning with care and prevent a war :)</p>

              <p>You built an application. Then you scaled up your application, added more user, added more servers. Everything would seem fine until at some moment, server may get different outcomes processing data with the same data in high traffic application. It might be race condition: altering/submitting data in unsafe manner. It can be SQL, thread, or even multi-machine communication. Race condition is catastrophic because it does not show up in small, low-traffic application. In this talk, i will tell what race condition is and we will see common pitfall in building high traffic application. Of course we will also discuss on how to avoid it in Rails.</p>

              <h4>Conference Code of Conduct</h4>
              <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>

              <h4>The Quick Version</h4>
              <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
              <h4>The Less Quick Version</h4>
              <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
              <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
              <p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.</p>
              <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
              <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts.</p>
              <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
              <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>
